# **Predictive Analysis (Classification)** ðŸ§ 

In this module, you will use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. The data will be split into training and testing sets to identify the best hyperparameters for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Finally, you will evaluate which method performs best using the test data.
