# **Introduction** 🚀

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of **$62 million**, while other providers charge upwards of **$165 million**. The significant savings stem from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. If we can predict the success of a first-stage landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information is crucial for alternate companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

In this module, you will be introduced to the problem and equipped with the tools necessary to complete the course.
